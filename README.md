- 👋 Hi, I’m @gtsc! I am working as Software Engineer at [Oracle Red Bull Racing](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en)
- 🧑‍💻 C++ software development, clean code and parallel computing is what keeps me awake at night; I love to talk about HPC, new hardware and numerical simulations, especially computational fluid dynamics

- 🌊 In my day-to-day job, I am working on developing pre- and postprocessing tools for CFD simulations, facilitating engineers to build the fastest Formula 1 car currently on track
- 🌱 In my personal projects, I’m currently focusing on extending my knowledge on (C++) software development best practices and tooling; the focus of these projects is connected to my hobbies, so they usually revolve around sports 🚴⛵🏋️🏃, boardgames 🎲, literature 📚 or music 🎧
- 🙋‍♂️ If you want to talk about anything like that, you can contact me via [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/tschirschnitz/) or via mail
