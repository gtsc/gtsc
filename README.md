- 👋 Hi, I'm @gtsc! I'm a Senior Software Engineer at [Oracle Red Bull Racing](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en), developing simulation tools in Formula 1.
- 🧑‍💻 My expertise spans using C++ and Python for building high-performance computing and scientific applications. I geek out about numerical simulation, new hardware, and DevOps practices. I'm particularly drawn to projects where software solves complex engineering challenges at the intersection of computational efficiency and physical systems.
- 🌊 In my day job, I work on pre- and postprocessing tools for CFD simulations that help engineers design the fastest cars on track, with a background in computational fluid dynamics from my time leading solver development at Dive CAE.
- 🌱 My personal projects focus on software development best practices and typically connect to my interests in outdoor activities 🚴🧗🏋️🏃, boardgames 🎲, literature 📚 and music 🎧
- 🙋‍♂️ If you want to talk about anything like that, feel free to contact me via [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/tschirschnitz/).
