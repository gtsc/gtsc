- 👋 Hi, I’m @gtsc! I am working as Software Engineer at [Oracle Red Bull Racing](https://www.redbullracing.com/int-en)
- 🧑‍💻 C++ software development, clean code and high-performance computing is what keeps me awake at night. I geek out about numerical simulation, new hardware and DevOps. Lately, I am particularly interested in Python software development, software testing frameworks and latest developments in the C++ tooling ecosystem.

- 🌊 In my day job, I am working on developing pre- and postprocessing tools for CFD simulations, facilitating engineers to build the fastest Formula 1 car on track
- 🌱 In my personal projects, I’m currently focusing on extending my knowledge on (C++) software development best practices and tooling; the focus of these projects is connected to my hobbies, so they usually revolve around sports 🚴🧗🏋️🏃, boardgames 🎲, literature 📚 or music 🎧
- 🙋‍♂️ If you want to talk about anything like that, you can contact me via [LinkedIn](http://linkedin.com/in/tschirschnitz/) or via mail
